#Representation Theory Notes

These are notes I've compiled in the summer of 2017 on the representation theory of finite groups. Most of the notes came from Artin, but the incomplete portion comes out of Dummit and Foote. I plan to revisit this soon, perhaps working out of Fulton and Harris' text on representaion theory.
