\section{Multilinear Algebra}
%
Tensors fields will play an important role in thr study of manifolds, so
it's important to see the linear model first. In this way. we can see how
to transport knowledge of the linear case to the nonlinear case of
manifolds. As it turns out, tensors are the proper way the think about
integration on a manifold, which is one of their many uses. \\
%
The central idea of tensors is \emph{multilinearity}. Let $V_1 \ldots V_n$
be vector spaces. Then a function $F : V_1 \times \cdots \times V_n \to
\R$ is \ib{multilinear} if it is linear in each term with the other terms
fixed, i.e.
$$F(v_1, \ldots \lambda v_i + \mu v_i', \ldots, v_n) =
\lambda F(v_1, \ldots v_i, \ldots v_n) +
\mu F(v_1 \ldots, v_i', \ldots, v_n)$$
%
\begin{defn}
Let $V_1 \cdots V_k$ be finite dimensional vector spaces. Then the
\ib{tensor product} of $V_1 \cdots V_k$ is a vector space, denoted
$V_1 \otimes \cdots \otimes V_k$ equipped with a multilinear map
$V_1 \times \cdots \times V_k \to V \otimes \cdots \otimes V_k$ satisfying
the follwing \ib{universal property} : Given a multilinear map
$\varphi : V_1 \times \cdots \times V_k \to W$ for any vector space $W$,
there exists a unique map
$\tilde{\varphi} : V_1 \otimes \cdots \otimes V_k$ such that the following
diagram
$$\begin{tikzcd}
V_1 \times \cdots \times V_k \ar[dr, "\varphi"] \ar[d] \\
V_1 \otimes \cdots \otimes V_k \ar[r, "\tilde{\varphi}"'] & W
\end{tikzcd}$$
commutes.
\end{defn}
%
\begin{defn}
Let $V$ be a finite dimensional vector space. Then the \ib{dual space} $V^*$ of $V$ is the vector space of linear maps $V \to \R$.
\end{defn}
