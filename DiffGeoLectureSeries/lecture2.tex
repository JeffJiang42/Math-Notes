\section{Multilinear Algebra}
%
Tensors fields will play an important role in thr study of manifolds, so
it's important to see the linear model first. In this way. we can see how
to transport knowledge of the linear case to the nonlinear case of
manifolds. As it turns out, tensors are the proper way the think about
integration on a manifold, which is one of their many uses. \\
%
Recall that the \ib{dual space} $V^*$ of a vector space $V$ is the vector space
of linear maps $V \to \R$. Dual spaces will be the building blocks of
multilinear functions The central idea of tensors is \emph{multilinearity}.
Let $V_1 \ldots V_n$ be vector spaces. Then a function
$F : V_1 \times \cdots \times V_n \to \R$ is \ib{multilinear} if it is linear
in each term with the other terms fixed, i.e.
$$F(v_1, \ldots \lambda v_i + \mu v_i', \ldots, v_n) =
\lambda F(v_1, \ldots v_i, \ldots v_n) +
\mu F(v_1 \ldots, v_i', \ldots, v_n)$$
%
\begin{defn}
Let $V_1 \cdots V_k$ be finite dimensional vector spaces. Then the
\ib{tensor product} of $V_1 \cdots V_k$ is a vector space, denoted
$V_1 \otimes \cdots \otimes V_k$ equipped with a multilinear map
$V_1 \times \cdots \times V_k \to V \otimes \cdots \otimes V_k$ satisfying
the follwing \ib{universal property} : Given a multilinear map
$\varphi : V_1 \times \cdots \times V_k \to W$ for any vector space $W$,
there exists a unique linear map
$\tilde{\varphi} : V_1 \otimes \cdots \otimes V_k$ such that the following
diagram
$$\begin{tikzcd}
V_1 \times \cdots \times V_k \ar[dr, "\varphi"] \ar[d] \\
V_1 \otimes \cdots \otimes V_k \ar[r, "\tilde{\varphi}"'] & W
\end{tikzcd}$$
commutes.
\end{defn}
%
We've given the universal property, but we haven't guaranteed that such
a vector space exists.
%
\begin{thm}
Let $V_1, \ldots V_k$ be finite dimensional vector spaces, and let
$F(V_1, \ldots, V_k)$ denote the \ib{free vector space} on
$V_1, \ldots V_k$, i.e. formal linear combinations of $k$-tuples
$(v_1,\ldots,v_k)$ with $v_i \in V_i$. Then let $R$ denote the subspace
spanned by elements of the form
\begin{align*}
&(v_1, \ldots \lambda v_i, \ldots v_k) -
\lambda (v_1, \ldots v_i, \ldots v_k)\\
&(v_1, \ldots, v_i + v_i', \ldots v_k) - (v_1, \ldots v_i, \ldots v_k)
- (v_1, \ldots v_i', \ldots v_k)
\end{align*}
Let $v_1 \otimes \cdots \otimes v_k$ denote the image of $(v_1, \ldots v_k)$
under the quotient projection. Then the vector space $F(V_1, \ldots V_k) / R$,
equipped with the map $V_1 \times \cdots V_k \to F(V_1, \ldots V_k) / R$ given
by $(v_1, \ldots, v_k) \mapsto v_1 \otimes \cdots \otimes v_k$ satisfies the
universal property of the tensor product.
\end{thm}
%
The reason we are about tensor products, is that it gives us the tools to
describe multilinear maps.
%
\begin{thm}
Let $L(V_1, \ldots, V_k)$ denote the space of multilinear maps
$V_1 \times \cdots \times V_k \to \R$. Then there is a canonical isomorphism
$V_1^* \otimes \cdots \otimes V_k^* \cong L(V_1 \ldots, V_k)$
\end{thm}
%
\begin{proof}
We define $\varphi : V_1 \otimes \cdots \otimes V_k \to L(V_1, \ldots, V_k)$ by
specifying it's action on the spanning set of elements of the form
$v^1 \otimes \cdots \otimes v^k$ and extending linearly to linear combinations.
$$\varphi(v^1 \otimes \cdots \otimes v^k)(w_1, \ldots w_k) =
\prod_i v^i(w_i)$$
\end{proof}
%
\begin{exer}
Prove the map $\varphi$ is an isomorphism.
\end{exer}
%
\begin{defn}
A \ib{covariant} $k$-tensor on a vector space $V$ is an element of
$\underbrace{V^* \otimes \ldots \otimes V^*}_{k \text{ times}}$. A
\ib{contravariant} $k$ tensor is an element of $\underbrace{V \otimes \ldots \otimes V}_{k \text{ times}}$. A $(k,\ell)$-tensor is an element of
$\underbrace{V^* \otimes \ldots \otimes V^*}_{k \text{ times}} \otimes
\underbrace{V \otimes \ldots \otimes V}_{\ell \text{ times}}$. We denote the
vector space of covariant, contravariant, and mixed tensors as $T^k(V)$,
$T_k(V)$, and $T^k_\ell(V)$ respectively.
\end{defn}
%
The central idea behind integration is \emph{volume}. If you think about your
calculus classes (especially vector calculus), you recall that the things
you integrate tend to be infinitesimal areas or volumes, and you might have
thought of the formal symbols $dA$ and $dx~dy$ as symbols representing
tiny squares or parallelograms.
