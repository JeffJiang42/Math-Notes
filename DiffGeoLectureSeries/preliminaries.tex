\begin{defn}
	A map $F : U \to V$ where $U \subset \R^n$ and $V \subset \R^m$ is \ib{smooth} if all of its
	component functions are infinitely differentiable, i.e. the partial derivatives of all orders
	exist and are continuous.
\end{defn}
%
Note that smoothness is a local condition -- to know a function is smooth at a point, it suffices to check
in a small neighborhood.
