# Differential Geometry Lecture Series

These are notes I'm preparing for the differential geometry lecture series for the 
math club in spring 2019. The general plan for the lectures is

1. Preliminary multivariable calculus/analysis, the definition of a manifold,
and tangent spaces
2. Vector fields and flows
3. Multilinear algebra and differential forms
