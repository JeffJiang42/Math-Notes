\section{Linear Algebra}
%
\begin{defn}
Let $V$ be a finite dimensional $\R$-vector space. An \ib{almost complex structure} on
$V$ is a linear map $J : V \to V$ satisfying $J^2 = \id_V$. An \ib{almost complex
vector space} is tuple $(V,J)$, where $V$ is a finite dimensional $\R-$vector space
equipped with an almost complex structure $J$.
\end{defn}
%
The data of an almost complex structure $J$ is equivalent to giving $V$ the structure
of a complex vector space, where we define $(a + bi)\cdot v = ab + bJv$. Because of this,
we may call $J$ a \ib{complex structure}. We use the name \emph{almost} complex
structure to emphasize the differences between the analogous constructions in the
nonlinear world of manifolds. Note that since an almost complex structure is equivalent
to a complex structure, this immediately implies that $V$ is even dimensional. \\

One way to think about an almost complex structure is through the geometric
interpretation of complex multiplication. If we regard $\C$ as a $2$-dimensional vector
space over $\R$, multiplication by $i$ corresponds to a rotation by $\pi/2$ in the
counterclockwise direction, and multiplication by $-i$ corresponds to a rotation by
$\pi/2$ in the clockwise direction. From this we see that a choice of a square root
of $-1$ comes with a choice of clockwise or counterclockwise. This implies that
every complex vector space is canonically oriented as a real vector space. Given a
$\C$-vector space $V$ with $\C$-basis $\set{z_1, \ldots, z_n}$, we have that the ordered
basis $(z_1, iz_1, \ldots z_n, iz_n)$ defines a positively oriented basis for $V$ over
$\R$.
%
\begin{defn}
Let $V$ by any $\R$-vector space. The \ib{complexification} of $V$ is the complex
vector space $V_\C = \C \otimes_\R V$. The complexification $V_\C$ is naturally a
complex vector space, where for $\lambda \in \C$, the action of $\lambda$ on a
homogeneous element $\mu \otimes v$ is given by
\[
\lambda \cdot (\mu \otimes v) = \lambda\mu \otimes v
\]
\end{defn}
%
The complexification is a different way of obtaining a complex vector space from a real
one. The complexification $V_\C$ is a vector space of twice the dimension of $V$ as a
vector space over $\R$. In addition, there is a natural inclusion
$V \hookrightarrow V_\C$ given by $v \mapsto 1 \otimes v$. Complexification is an
instance of \emph{extension of scalars} -- every element of $V_\C$ is of the form
$av + biw$ where $a,b \in \R$, and $v,w \in V$. Therefore, we will denote the element
$(a + bi) \otimes v \in V_\C$ by $av + biv$, and we have a direct sum decomposition
$V_\C = V \oplus iV$.   Given a linear map $T : V \to W$ of $\R$-vector spaces, we can
extend $T$ to a complexified map $T_\C : V_\C \to W_\C$, where
$T_\C(av + biw) = aTv + biTv$. In other words, $T_\C = \id_\C \otimes T$. In this way,
we see that complexification defines a covariant functor
$\mathsf{Vect}_\R \to \mathsf{Vect}_\C$ from the category of $\R$-vector spaces to the
category of $\C$-vector spaces. \\

A natural question to ask is how an almost complex structure interacts with
the process of complexification. Let $(V,J)$ be an almost complex vector space. Then the
complexified map $J_\C : V_\C \to V_\C$ squares to $-1$, and admits eigenvalues
$\pm i$. For example, consider $V = \C$. We then can then make the natural
identification of $\C$ with the almost complex vector space $(\R^2, J)$, where $J$
is given by the matrix
\[
J = \begin{pmatrix}
0 & -1 \\
1 & 0
\end{pmatrix}
\]
using the ordered $\R$ basis $(1,i)$. Then $V_\C = \C \otimes_\R \C = \C^2$, and $J_\C$
is given by the matrix
\[
J_\C = \begin{pmatrix}
0 & -1 & 0 & 0 \\
1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & -1 \\
0 & 0 & 1 & 0
\end{pmatrix}
\]
in the ordered $\R$ basis $(1, i, 1, i)$, where the first pair elements are elements of
one copy of $\C^2$, and the second pair of elements are elements of a separate copy of
$\C^2$, giving an $\R$ basis for $\C \cong \C \oplus \C$. The matrix $J_\C$
clearly has eigenvalues $\pm i$, with the $i$-eigenspace being spanned by the
vectors
\[
\begin{pmatrix}
\frac{1}{2} \\[5pt]
0 \\[5pt]
\frac{1}{2} \\[5pt]
0
\end{pmatrix}, \begin{pmatrix}
\frac{i}{2} \\[5pt]
0 \\[5pt]
-\frac{i}{2} \\[5pt]
0
\end{pmatrix}
\]
and the $-i$ eigenspace being the span of
\[
\begin{pmatrix}
0 \\[5pt]
\frac{1}{2} \\[5pt]
0 \\[5pt]
\frac{1}{2}
\end{pmatrix}, \begin{pmatrix}
0 \\[5pt]
\frac{i}{2} \\[5pt]
0 \\[5pt]
-\frac{i}{2}
\end{pmatrix}
\]
The case for general $V$ is similar, and amounts to fixing an $\R$ basis of the
form $\set{v_1, Jv_1, \ldots v_n, Jv_n}$ for $(V,J)$. The decomposition of $V_\C$ into
the $\pm i$-eigenspaces of $J_\C$ gives a direct sum decomposition
\[
V_\C = V^{1,0} \oplus V^{0,1}
\]
where $V^{1,0}$ denotes the $i$-eigenspace, and $V^{0,1}$ denotes the $-i$-eigenspace.
Note that in the bases we chose above for $\C^2$, complex conjugation is given by the
matrix
\[
\begin{pmatrix}
0 & 1 & 0 & 0\\
1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
0 & 0 & 1 & 0
\end{pmatrix}
\]
and determines an isomorphism of complex vector spaces
$V^{1,0} \cong \overline{V^{0,1}}$ and vice versa. In addition, complex conjugation
picks out a distinguished subspace of $V_\C$ isomorphic to $V$ -- the $1$-eigenspace.
Elements of this eigenspace are called \ib{real} (much like how the $\R^n$
is left invariant under complex conjugation in $\C^n$). \\

An almost complex structure $J$ on $V$ induces a dual map $J^* : V^* \to V^*$. By
functoriality of taking dual spaces, $(J^*) ^2 = -\id_{V^*}$, giving $V^*$ the
structure of an almost complex vector space via $J^*$. Explicitly, given a linear
functional $\alpha \in V^*$, we have that the action of $J^*$ on $\alpha$ is given
by
\[
(J^*\alpha)(v) = \alpha(Jv)
\]
for every $v \in V$. We then get an analogous decomposition of the complexified
dual space$ V^*_\C = \hom_\R(V,\C)$ as
\[
V^*_\C = (V^*)^{1,0} \oplus (V^*)^{0,1}
\]
into the $\pm i$ eigenspaces of $J^*$, and have very natural interpretations in
terms of $V$. The subspace $(V^*)^{1,0}$ consists of the $\alpha$ such that
$\alpha(Jv) = i\alpha(v)$. We have a natural pairing $(V^*)^{1,0} \otimes V^{1,0} \to \C$
given by
\[
\langle \alpha,v \rangle = \alpha(v)
\]
which is nondegenerate, establishing the two vector spaces as dual to each other (as
complex vector spaces). A similar statement holds for $V^{0,1}$ and $(V^*)^{0,1}$,
putting them in duality as well. Another perspective to take is that the condition
that $\alpha(Jv) = i\alpha(v)$ is equivalent to $\alpha$ being \emph{complex linear}
with respect to the complex structure $J$ on $V$ and $i$ on $\C$, giving us an
isomorphism $(V^*)^{1,0} \cong \hom_\C(V,\C)$. Similarly, we have that
$(V^*)^{0,1} \cong \hom_{\C}(V,\overline{\C})$.\\

We the consider the effects of complexification on another linear algebraic construction
--the exterior algebra. Given a finite dimensional $\R$-vector space $V$, we have that
the exterior algebra $\Lambda^\bullet V$ has a natural $\Z$-grading
\[
\Lambda^\bullet V = \bigoplus_{k = 0}^n \Lambda^kV
\]
Upon complexification, we have a canonical isomorphism
$(\Lambda^\bullet V)_\C \cong \Lambda^\bullet V_\C$, where the right hand side is the
exterior algebra of $V_\C$ as a \emph{complex} vector space
(i.e. $\Lambda^0 V_\C \cong \C$, not $\R$), and $\Lambda^\bullet V$ is canonically
embedded in $\Lambda^\bullet V_\C$ as the subspace invariant under complex conjugation.
Further assume that we have an almost complex structure $J : V \to V$. This gives a
direct sum decomposition $V_\C = V^{1,0} \oplus V^{0,1}$, which then induces a
decomposition
\[
\Lambda^kV_\C \cong \bigoplus_{p+q=k}\Lambda^pV^{1,0} \otimes_\C \Lambda^q V^{0,1}
\]
giving the complexified exterior algebra a bigrading via the subspaces
\[
\Lambda^{p,q}V \defeq \Lambda^p V^{1,0} \otimes_\C \Lambda^q V^{0,1}
\]
elements of $\Lambda^{p,q}$ are said to have \ib{bidegree} $(p,q)$. We now make several
simple observations regarding the bigrading of $\Lambda^\bullet V_\C$, which stem from
our observations regarding the decomposition $V_\C = V^{1,0} \oplus V^{0,1}$.
%
\begin{enumerate}
  \item From the fact that $\overline{V^{1,0}} = V^{0,1}$, we get that
  $\overline{\Lambda^{p,q}V} = \Lambda^{q,p}V$.
  \item Given $\omega \in \Lambda^{p,q}V$ and $\eta \in \Lambda^{s,t}V$, we have that
  $\omega \wedge \eta \in \Lambda^{p+s,q+t}V$.
\end{enumerate}
%
\section{Complex Manifolds}
%
We now transfer our linear algebraic knowledge to complex manifolds. Let $U \subset \C$
be an open subset, and $z = x + iy$ the usual coordinate function on $U$. Considered
as a subset of $\R^2$, for any point $p \in U$, the tangent space $T_pU$ is spanned by
the coordinate vectors $\partial_x\vert_p$ and $\partial_y\vert_p$. If we then
complexify, the $\partial_x\vert_p$ and $\partial_y\vert_p$ also form a basis for
$(T_pU)_\C$ as a \emph{complex} vector space. Consequently, we can also form a
basis for $(T_pU)_\C$ with the vectors
%
\begin{align*}
\frac{\partial}{\partial z}\bigg\vert_p &\defeq
\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial x} - i\frac{\partial}{\partial y}\right) \\
\frac{\partial}{\partial\overline{z}}\bigg\vert_p &\defeq
\frac{1}{2}\left( \frac{\partial}{\partial x} + i\frac{\partial}{\partial y}\right)
\end{align*}
%
which we abbreviate as $\partial_z\vert_p$ and $\partial{\overline{z}}\vert_p$
respectively. Doing this for all $p$, we obtain vector fields $\partial_z$ and
$\partial_{\overline{z}}$ on all of $U$, where a function $f \in C^\infty(U, \C)$ is
holomorphic if and only if $\partial_{\overline{z}}f = 0$. Functions $f$ annihilated by
$\partial_z$ are \ib{antiholomorphic}, i.e. $\overline{f}$ is holomorphic. These
vector fields give a framing for the complexified tangent bundle $TU_\C$, i.e. an
isomorphism $TU_\C \to U \times \C^2$. \\

We get a similar description of the complexified cotangent bundle $T^*U_\C$, which
is framed by the covector fields
%
\begin{align*}
dz = \frac{1}{2}\left(dx + idy\right) \\
d\overline{z} = \frac{1}{2}\left( dx -idy\right)
\end{align*}
%
which are easily verified to the duals of $\partial_z$ and $\partial_{\overline{z}}$
respectively. For an open subset $U \subset \C^n$ with complex coordinates
$z^i = x^i +iy^i$, we have analogous vector fields $\partial/\partial z^i$ and
$\partial/\partial\overline{z}^i$ and covector fields $dz^i$ and $d\overline{z}^i$.
%
\begin{defn}
An \ib{almost complex manifold} is the data of a smooth manifold $X$ and a smooth
section $J \in \Gamma_X(\End(TX))$ such that $J^2 = -\id_{TX}$.
\end{defn}
%
\begin{defn}
A \ib{complex manifold} is a smooth manifold $X$ such that there is an open cover
$\set{(U_\alpha, \varphi_\alpha)}$ of $X$ by charts $U_\alpha$ and diffeomorphisms
$\varphi: U_\alpha \to V_\alpha$ to open sets $V_\alpha \subset \R^{2n} \cong \C^n$
such that the transition maps $\varphi_\alpha \circ \varphi_\beta\inv$ are holomorphic.
\end{defn}
%
\begin{defn}
Let $X$ be a complex manifold. A complex valued function $f \in C^\infty(X,\C)$ is
\ib{holomorphic} if for any holomorphic chart $(\varphi, U)$, we have that
$f \circ \varphi\inv$ is holomorphic. The ring of holomorphic functions over $X$ is
denoted $\O_X$.
\end{defn}
%
Unlike the linear case, the notion of an almost complex manifold and a complex manifold
are \emph{not} equivalent. Let $(X,J)$ be an almost complex manifold. For a point
$x \in X$, we have that $J_x$ is an almost complex structure on the tangent space
$T_xX$, which gives a decomposition of the complexified tangent space
\[
T_xX_\C = T_x^{1,0}X \oplus T_x^{0,1}X
\]
into the $\pm i$-eigenspaces of complexified $J_x$. Doing this over all points $x$,
we get a decomposition of the complexified tangent bundle
\[
TX_\C = T^{1,0}X \oplus T^{0,1}X
\]
into the $\pm i$-eigenbundles of $J$.\\

Suppose $X$ is a complex manifold. Then every tangent space $T_xX$ inherits an almost
complex structure coming from multiplication by $i$ in $\C^n$, giving an almost complex
structure $J$ on $X$. To show this explicitly, let $z^i = x^i + iy^i$ be local
holomorphic coordinates for $X$. Then the coordinate functions
$(x^1, y^1, \ldots x^n, y^n)$ form a coordinate system for $X$ as a \emph{real} manifold,
and the action of $J$ in these coordinates is simply given by
%
\begin{align*}
\frac{\partial}{\partial x^i} &\mapsto \frac{\partial}{\partial y^i} \\
\frac{\partial}{\partial y^i} &\mapsto -\frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}
\end{align*}
%
and the subbundle $T^{1,0}X \subset TX_\C$ is spanned by the $\partial/\partial z^i$,
and $T^{0,1}X$ is spanned by the $\partial/\partial\overline{z}^i$. The composition
\[\begin{tikzcd}
TX \ar[r,hookrightarrow] & TX_\C \ar[r] & T^{1,0}X
\end{tikzcd}\]
consisting of the inclusion followed by projecting then defines an isomorphism of
the real tangent bundle with $T^{1,0}X$, which is called the
\ib{holomorphic tangent bundle}. Explicitly, this map is given in local coordinates by
%
\begin{align*}
\frac{\partial}{\partial x^i} &=
\frac{\partial}{\partial z^i} + \frac{\partial}{\partial\overline{z}^i}
\mapsto \frac{\partial}{\partial z^i} \\
\frac{\partial}{\partial y^i} &=
i\frac{\partial}{\partial z^i} - i\frac{\partial}{\partial\overline{z}^i}
\mapsto i\frac{\partial}{\partial z^i}
\end{align*}
%
and the $\partial/\partial z^i$ along with the $i\partial/\partial z^i$ form a local
frame for the holomorphic tangent bundle $T^{1,0}X$.\\

Given an almost complex manifold $(X,J)$, a natural question to ask is whether or not
$X$ admits the structure of a complex manifold where $J$ is multiplication by $i$.
The answer to this question is a celebrated theorem of Newlander and Nirenberg
%
\begin{thm}[\ib{Newlander-Nirenberg}]
An almost complex manifold $(X,J)$ is a complex manifold (where $J$ is multiplication by
$i$) if and only if the subbundle $T^{1,0}X \subset TX_\C$ is integrable in the sense
of Frobenius, i.e.
\[
[T^{1,0}X, T^{1,0}X] \subset T^{1,0}X
\]
via complex conjugation, this is equivalent to $T^{0,1}X$ being integrable.
\end{thm}
%
Intuitively, the existence of local \emph{holomorphic} coordinates amounts to
finding an integral submanifold for $T^{1,0}X$, since if $X$ was complex, $T^{1,0}X$
would arise as the holomorphic tangent bundle of $X$.
%
\section{Cohomology of Complex Manifolds.}
%
Let $X$ be a complex manifold, and let $J$ denote the canonical almost complex structure
on $X$. Applying our linear algebraic knowledge pointwise, we get a decomposition of
the complexified cotangent bundle
\[
T^*X_\C = (T^*X)^{1,0} \oplus (T^*X)^{0,1}
\]
%
which then gives a decomposition of the space $\Omega^k_X(\C)$ of complex valued
differential $k$-forms as
\[
\Omega^k_X(\C) = \bigoplus_{p+q=k}\Omega^{p,q}_X(\C)
\]
where $\Omega^{p,q}_X(\C)$ denotes the space of $(p,q)$-forms, i.e. sections of
$\Lambda^{p,q}T^*X$, and the direct sum is taken as modules over $C^\infty(X,\C)$.
Out of all the $\Lambda^{p,q}T^*X$, there is a distinguished bundle.
%
\begin{defn}
Let $X$ be a complex manifold of complex dimension $\dim_\C X = n$ (i.e. $\dim X = 2n)$.
The \ib{canonical bundle} of $X$, denote $K_X$, is the complex vector bundle
\[
K_X = \Lambda^{n,0}T^*X
\]
\end{defn}
%
Let $d$ denote the de Rham differential $\Omega^k_X \to \Omega^{k+1}_X$ after
complexifying it to obtain a map $\Omega^k_X(\C) \to \Omega^{k+1}_X(\C)$. In local
holomorphic coordinates $\set{z^i}$, we have that the $dz^i$ form a basis for the space
of smooth $(1,0)$-forms over the ring $C^\infty(M,\C)$, and the $d\overline{z}^i$ form a
basis for the space of smooth $(0,1)$-forms. Therefore, given $f \in C^\infty(X,\C)$, we
can uniquely write $df \in \Omega^1_X(\C)$ as
\[
df = \frac{\partial f}{\partial z^i}dz^i +
\frac{\partial f}{\partial\overline{z}^i}d\overline{z}^i
\]
where we use Einstein summation notation. Given an arbitrary $(p,q)$ form $\alpha$, it
has the local coordinate expression
\[
\alpha = \sum_{p,q} \alpha_{p,q} dz^{i_1} \wedge \ldots \wedge dz^{i_p} \wedge
d\overline{z}^{i_1}\ldots \wedge d\overline{z}^{i_q}
\]
for smooth $\alpha_{p,q} \in C^\infty(X,\C)$. Then we have that
%
\begin{align*}
d\alpha &= \left(\sum_{p,q}\frac{\partial\alpha_{p,q}}{\partial z^i} dz^i
\wedge dz^{i_1} \wedge \ldots \wedge dz^{i_p} \wedge
d\overline{z}^{i_1}\ldots \wedge d\overline{z}^{i_q}\right) \\[5pt]
&+ \left(
\sum_{p,q}\frac{\partial\alpha_{p,q}}{\partial \overline{z}^i} d\overline{z}^i
\wedge dz^{i_1} \wedge \ldots \wedge dz^{i_p} \wedge
d\overline{z}^{i_1}\ldots \wedge d\overline{z}^{i_q}
\right)
\end{align*}
%
which shows that $d\alpha$ is a $(p+1,q+1)$ form, i.e. $d$ is of bidegree $(1,1)$. This
expression for $d\alpha$ allows us to decompose $d$ as a sum $d = \partial + \dbar$,
where
%
\begin{align*}
\partial\alpha &= \sum_{p,q}\frac{\partial\alpha_{p,q}}{\partial z^i} dz^i
\wedge dz^{i_1} \wedge \ldots \wedge dz^{i_p} \wedge
d\overline{z}^{i_1}\ldots \wedge d\overline{z}^{i_q} \\[5pt]
\dbar\alpha &= \sum_{p,q}\frac{\partial\alpha_{p,q}}{\partial \overline{z}^i}
d\overline{z}^i \wedge dz^{i_1} \wedge \ldots \wedge dz^{i_p} \wedge
d\overline{z}^{i_1}\ldots \wedge d\overline{z}^{i_q}
\end{align*}
%
from the definition, it is clear that $\partial$ is of bidegree $(1,0)$ and $\dbar$ is
of bidegree $(0,1)$.
%
\begin{prop}\enumbreak
\begin{enumerate}
  \item $\partial^2 = 0$
  \item $\dbar^2 = 0$
  \item $\partial\dbar + \dbar\partial = 0$
\end{enumerate}
\end{prop}
%
\begin{proof}
We know that $d = \partial + \dbar$ satisfies $d^2 = 0$. Therefore, we have that
\[
d^2 = (\partial +\dbar)^2 = \partial^2 + \partial\dbar + \dbar\partial + \dbar^2
\]
we then note that the bidegrees of all the components. We have:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item $\partial^2$ has bidegree $(2,0)$.
  \item $\partial\dbar + \dbar\partial$ has bidegree $(1,1)$
  \item $\dbar^2$ has bidegree $(0,2)$
\end{enumerate}
in order for $d^2$ to vanish, all the terms of different bidegrees must vanish, proving
all three parts of the proposition.
\end{proof}
%
The operators $\partial$ and $\dbar$ satisfy many of the same identities as $d$. Another
helpful identity to note is that
\[
\partial\alpha = \overline{\dbar\overline{\alpha}}
\]
\begin{defn}
Let $X$ be a complex manifold. A \ib{holomorphic vector bundle} over $X$ is a
complex vector bundle $\pi : E \to X$ such that the total space $E$ is a complex
manifold
and the projection $\pi$ is a holomorphic map.
\end{defn}
%
\begin{exmp}
For a complex manifold $X$, the complex vector bundles $\Lambda^{q,0}T^*X$ are all
holomorphic vector bundles, which is easily seen using local trivializations defined
by local holomorphic coordinates.
\end{exmp}
%
Note again that a holomorphic vector bundle is \emph{not} a complex vector bundle
(for example, a complex vector bundle can be odd dimensional if the base space is
odd dimensional). Instead, it is a complex bundle with extra structure. Let
$\sigma : X \to E$ be a \emph{smooth} section. In a local holomorphic trivialization of
$E$, we can write $\sigma$ as
\[
\sigma = (\sigma^1, \ldots, \sigma^k)
\]
for smooth complex-valued functions $\sigma^i$,  where $k$ is the rank of $E$ as a
complex vector bundle. In this trivialization, we can apply the operator $\dbar$
component-wise to get
\[
\dbar\sigma = (\dbar\sigma^1,\ldots,\dbar\sigma^k)
\]
and this local definition glues together to give a well defined operator
$\dbar_E : \Omega^{0,0}_X(E) \to \Omega^{0,1}_X(E)$, where $\Omega^{p,q}_X(E)$ denotes
the space of sections $\Gamma_X(T^{p,q}X \otimes_\C E)$. We then note that the
holomorphic sections $X \to E$ are exactly those annihilated by $\dbar_E$. Since
$\dbar_E$ is defined locally in terms of $\dbar$, we immediately see that
$\dbar_E^2 = 0$, giving us the
\ib{Dolbeault complex} of $E$.
\[\begin{tikzcd}
\Omega^{0,0}_X(E) \ar[r, "\dbar_E"] & \Omega^{0,1}_X(E) \ar[r, "\dbar_E"] &
\cdots\cdots \ar[r, "\dbar_E"] & \Omega^{0,n}_X(E) \ar[r,"\dbar_E"] & 0
\end{tikzcd}\]
%
The \ib{Dolbeault cohomology groups} of $E$ are the cohomology groups of the
Dolbeault complex, and are denoted $H^p(X,E)$. In the case $E = \Lambda^{0,q}T^*X$,
we have that $\dbar_E = \dbar$, and we denote these cohomology groups by
\[
H^{p,q}(X) = H^p(X,\Lambda^{0,q}T^*X)
\]
%
\section{K\"ahler Manifolds}
%
K\"ahler manifolds will form a special class of manifolds where Hodge theory
will prove especially useful. Before diving into the world of K\"ahler manifolds,
we do some prerequisite linear algebra, which is closely tied to Hermitian geometry.
%
\begin{defn}
Let $V$ be a complex vector space. A \ib{Hermitian form} on $V$ is a bilinear map
$h : \overline{V} \otimes_\C V \to \C$ satisfying $h(v,w) = \overline{h(w,v)}$.
\end{defn}
%
Another way to define a Hermitian form is as a \ib{sesquilinear} form
$h : V \otimes_\C V \to \C$, i.e. conjugate linear in the first term, and linear in the
second term, along with the Hermitian symmetry condition $h(v,w) = \overline{h(v,w)}$.
In a basis for $V$, a Hermitian form is given by a Hermitian matrix $H$, i.e.
$H^\dagger = H$. \\

Given a Hermitian form $h$ on a complex vector space $V$, we can decompose $h$ into
its real and imaginary parts. Let $g = \mathfrak{Re}(h)$ and
$\omega = \mathfrak{Im}(h)$, so we have $h = g + i\omega$.
%
\begin{prop}
Let $h = g + i\omega$ be a hermitian form. Then we have
\begin{enumerate}
  \item $g$ is symmetric
  \item $\omega$ is skew-symmetric
\end{enumerate}
\end{prop}
%
\begin{proof}\enumbreak
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Since $h$ is Hermitian, we have that $h(v,w) = \overline{h(w,v)}$, which have
  the same real part. Therefore, $g(v,w) = g(w,v)$, so $g$ is symmetric
  \item We again use the fact that $h(v,w) = \overline{h(w,v)}$. Since conjugation
  reverses the sign on the imaginary component, we immediately get that
  $\omega(v,w) = -\omega(w,v)$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{proof}
%
\begin{rem*}
The decomposition of $h$ into its real and imaginary components is one way of seeing
the useful identity
\[
U_n = O_{2n} \cap Sp_{2n} \cap GL_n\C
\]
where we regard all of the groups as subgroups of $GL_{2n}\R$. Any matrix preserving
the standard Hermitian form on $\C^n$ must necessarily preserve both the real and
imaginary components, so it must preserve the standard Euclidean inner product on
$\R^{2n} \cong \C^n$ and the standard symplectic form on $\R^{2n} \cong \C$.
\end{rem*}
%
Given a complex vector space $V$ equipped with a hermitian metric $h$, let $J$
denote the natural almost complex structure induced by multiplication by $i$.
Writing $h = g + i\omega$, we see that $\omega$ and $g$ are intimately related, i.e.
\begin{enumerate}
  \item $g(v,Iw) = \omega(v,w)$
  \item $\omega(v,Iw) = g(v,w)$
\end{enumerate}
%
both of which come from the fact that $h$ is compatible with $J$ in the sense that
$h(Jv,Jw) = h(v,w)$. Finally, we note that $\omega$ can be naturally identified
with a real element of $(V^*)^{1,1}$.
%
\begin{defn}
Let $h$ be a Hermitian form, and $\omega = \mathfrak{Im}(h)$. Then $\omega$ is called
the \ib{K\"ahler form} of $h$.
\end{defn}
%
We now move back to the world of manifolds. Let $(X,J)$ be an almost complex manifold.
The almost complex structure gives each tangent space $T_xX$ the structure of a complex
vector space, so it makes sense to discuss a Hermitian form $h_x$ on $T_xX$.
%
\begin{defn}
A \ib{K\"ahler manifold} is an almost complex manifold $(X,J)$ with a smoothly varying
Hermitian metric (i.e. a positive definite Hermitian form) $h$ where $J$ is integrable
and the K\"ahler form $\omega$ obtained from $h$ is closed.
\end{defn}
%
From the decomposition $h = g + i\omega$, we see that a K\"ahler manifold is a
melting pot of several compatible structures, namely the Riemannian metric $g$, the
almost complex structure $J$, and the symplectic form $\omega$. \\

From the basic definition, we can already make some surprisingly deep statements about
K\"ahler manifolds.
%
\begin{prop}
Let $X$ be a K\"ahler manifold with Hermitian form $h = g + i\omega$. Then the volume
form of $X$ with respect to the Riemannian metric $g$ is $\omega^n/n!$, where
$n = \dim_\C X$.
\end{prop}
%
\begin{proof}
It suffices to verify this pointwise for a fixed point $x \in X$.
The Riemannian volume form $dV_g$ is uniquely characterized by the fact that
$(dV_g)_x(e_1, \ldots, e_{2n}) = 1$ for an oriented orthonormal basis
$\set{e_1, \ldots e_{2n}}$ for $T_xX$. Arrange local holomorphic coordinates
$\set{z^i}$ about $x$ such that at $x$, the Hermitian form $h_x$ is given by the
identity matrix, i.e.
\[
h_x\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial z^i}\bigg\vert_x,
\frac{\partial}{\partial z^j}\bigg\vert_x\right) = \delta_{ij}
\]
Let $\partial_i$ denote $\partial/\partial z^i\vert_x$. We then have that
$\set{\partial_1, i\partial_1, \ldots \partial_n, i\partial_n}$ is an oriented
orthonormal $\R$-basis for $T_xX$ with respect to $g$, so it suffices to evaluate
$\omega^n_x$ on this basis, and verify that it evaluates to $n!$. To do this, we
use a lemma.
%
\begin{lem}
In local holomorphic coordinates $\set{z^i}$, the K\"ahler form $\omega$ is given by
\[
\omega = \frac{i}{2}\sum_i H^i_j dz^i \wedge d\zbar^i
\]
where $H^i_j = h(\partial_i, \partial_j)$.
\end{lem}
%
The proof is an easy consequence of $\omega$ being of type $(1,1)$ and the
fact that it is the imaginary component of $h$. \\

In the coordinates we specified above, we have that $H_x$ is the identity matrix,
so the lemma gives us
\[
\omega_x = \frac{i}{2}\sum_i dz^i \wedge d\zbar^i
\]
we note that when we wedge $\omega_x$ with itself $n$ times, we constantly pick
up duplicates of the $dz^i$ and $d\zbar^i$, so only one term survives, leaving us
with
\[
\omega_x^n = \frac{i}{2}\left(dz^1 \wedge d\zbar^i \wedge \cdots \wedge
dz^i \wedge d\zbar^i\right) = dx^1 \wedge dy^1 \wedge \cdots \wedge dx^n \wedge dy^n
= \frac{dV_g}{n!}
\]
where $z^i = x^i + iy^i$. We use the convention that
$v \wedge w = \mathrm{Alt}(v\otimes w)$ without the normalizing factor, which explains
the extra term of $n!$.
%
\end{proof}
%
\begin{prop}
Let $X$ be a K\"ahler manifold. Then all the even degree de Rham cohomology groups
$H^{2n}_{dR}(X,\R)$ are nontrivial.
\end{prop}
%
\begin{proof}
The fact that $\omega^n = dV_g/n!$ implies that
$\int_M \omega^n = \int_M dV_g = \mathrm{Vol}(M) > 0$, so by Stokes' theorem,
$\omega^n$ cannot be exact. From this, we can also conclude that $\omega^k$ for any
$k$ cannot be exact, for if $\omega^k = d\alpha$, then we would have that
\[
\omega^n = \omega^{n-k} \wedge d\alpha = d(\omega^{n-k} \wedge \alpha)
\]
Therefore, since $\omega$ is a degree $2$ form, we must have that all the even
dimensional cohomology groups are nontrivial
\end{proof}
%
This shows that the K\"ahler condition is quite rigid. A special property of K\"ahler
manifolds that the Hermitian form $h$ is constant up to second order terms, which is
an important ingredient in the K\"ahler identities. Because of this, many of of the
local computations on K\"ahler manifolds reduce to computation on the standard
Hermitian metric on $\C^n$.

%
\section{Laplacians and Harmonic Forms}
%
We start in the most general case, that of a compact Riemannian manifold $(X,g)$. For
the remainder of these notes, all manifolds will be compact and boundaryless,
unless denoted otherwise.
%
\begin{defn}
Let $(X,g)$ be a Riemannian manifold. Then the vector bundles $\Lambda^kT^*X$
inherit natural fiber metrics $(\cdot,\cdot)$, which are defined by the set
\[
\set{e_{i_1} \wedge \cdots \wedge e_{i_k} ~:~ 1 \leq i_1 < i_2 < \cdots < i_k}
\]
being an orthonormal basis for $\Lambda^kT^*_xX$ where $\set{e_i}$ is an orthonormal
basis for $T^*_xX$. This then introduces an \ib{$L^2$ inner product}
$(\cdot,\cdot)_{L^2}$ on the space $\Omega^k_X$ of differential $k$-forms, where we
define
\[
(\alpha,\beta)_{L^2} = \int_X (\alpha,\beta)~dV_g
\]
where $(\alpha,\beta)$ denotes the smooth function $x \mapsto (\alpha_x, \beta_x)$.
\end{defn}
%
\begin{defn}
The \ib{Hodge star} operator, denoted $\star$ (though many choose to denote it $*$), is
a bundle homomorphism $\star : \Lambda^kT^*X \to \Lambda^{n-k}T^*X$ defined by the
property such that for any $\alpha,\beta \in \Lambda^kT^*X$
\[
\alpha \wedge \star\beta = (\alpha,\beta)~dV_g
\]
this property uniquely characterizes $\star$.
\end{defn}
%
\begin{prop}
$\star$ exists.
\end{prop}
%
\begin{proof}
The defining property uniquely characterizes $\star$, so it suffices to specify a
local definition, which will then glue to a smooth bundle homomorphism. Let $E_i$ be a
local orthonormal frame for $T^*X$. Then we know that the set of $k$-fold wedge products
of the $E_i$ with increasing indices forms a basis for each $\Lambda^KT^*_xX$. In
addition, we know that $E_1 \wedge \cdots \wedge E_n = dV_g$. Putting this all together,
We must have that for $E_I = E_{i_1} \wedge \cdots E_{i_k}$, $\star E_I = E_J$, with
$J = \set{j_{i_1}, \ldots ,j_{i_{n-k}}}$ where the tuple
$(i_1, \ldots i_k,j_1, \ldots j_k)$ is an even permutation of $(1, \ldots ,n)$. We have
then specified $\star$ on an orthonormal basis.
\end{proof}
%
One thing to note is that $\star$ is an isomorphism, since it maps orthonormal frames
to orthonormal frames. It also satisfies the useful identity
\[
\star^2\alpha = (-1)^{k(n-k)}\alpha
\]
where $\alpha \in \Omega^k_X$. \\

Complexification allows us to obtain analogous operations on complex valued
forms on an almost complex manifold $(X,J)$, where we extend $g$ and its induced fiber
metrics on the $\Lambda^kT^*X$ to a Hermitian metric $h$ on $TX_\C$ and fiber metrics
on $\Lambda^KT^*X_\C$. Likewise, we complexify the Hodge star $\star$, which gives the
identity
\[
(\alpha,\beta)~dV_g = \alpha \wedge \overline{\star\beta}
\]
We then get an analogous $L^2$ metric on complex valued forms, defined by
\[
(\alpha,\beta)_{L^2} = \int_X \alpha \wedge \overline{\star\beta} ~dV_g
\]
The Hodge star operators allows us to define formal adjoints to $d$, $\partial$, and
$\dbar$ with respect to the $L^2$ metrics.
%
\begin{defn}
Define the operators
\begin{enumerate}
  \item $d^*: \Omega_X^k \to \Omega_X^{k-1}$
  \item $\partial^* : \Omega_X^{p,q}(\C) \to \Omega_X^{p-1,q}(\C)$
  \item $\dbar^* : \Omega_X^{p,q}(\C) \to \Omega_X^{p,q-1}(\C)$
\end{enumerate}
by the formulas
\begin{enumerate}
  \item $d^* = (-1)^k\star\inv d\star$
  \item $\partial^* = -\star\dbar\star$
  \item $\dbar^* = -\star\partial\star$
\end{enumerate}
\end{defn}
%
\begin{prop}
The operators $d^*$, $\partial^*$, and $\dbar^*$ are formally adjoints to their
respective operators with respect to the appropriate $L^2$ metrics, i.e.
\begin{align*}
(d\alpha,\beta)_{L^2} &= (\alpha, d^*\beta)_{L^2} \\
(\partial\alpha,\beta)_{L^2} &= (\alpha,\partial^*\beta) \\
(\dbar\alpha,\beta)_{L^2} &= (\alpha, \dbar^*\beta)
\end{align*}
\end{prop}
%
\begin{proof}
We prove the case for $d$ and $\dbar^*$. The proof for $\partial^*$ is near identical
to the one for $\dbar^*$. We know that the exterior derivative is an \ib{anti-derivation}
i.e. it satisfies
\[
d(\alpha \wedge \beta) = d\alpha \wedge \beta + (-1)^{k}d\beta
\]
where $k = |\alpha|$ denotes the degree of $\alpha$. In particular, this implies that
for a $k$-form $\alpha$ and a $k+1$-form $\beta$, we have that
\[
d(\alpha\wedge\star\beta) = d\alpha\wedge\star\beta + (-1)^k\alpha\wedge d\star\beta
\]
From Stokes' theorem, we have that
\[
\int_X d(\alpha\wedge\star\beta) = \int_{\partial X} \alpha\wedge\star\beta = 0
\]
since $\partial X = \emptyset$. Therefore, we have that
\[
\int_X d\alpha\wedge\star\beta = \int_X (-1)^{k+1}\alpha\wedge d\star\beta
\]
we further note that the left hand side is the definition of $(d\alpha,\beta)_{L^2}$.
We also compute
\begin{align*}
(\alpha,d^*\beta)_{L^2} &= \int_X \alpha\wedge\star d^*\beta \\
&= \int_X \alpha\wedge((-1)^{k+1}\star\star\inv d\star\beta) \\
&= \int_X (-1)^{k+1}\alpha\wedge d\star\beta
\end{align*}
proving the desired equality.

For $\dbar^*$, we have a similar proof. Let $\alpha$ be a complex $k$-form, and
$\beta$ a complex $k+1$-form. Then we have
\[
(\dbar\alpha,\beta)_{L^2} = \int_X\alpha\wedge\overline{\star\beta}
\]
again, we have that
\[
\dbar(\alpha\wedge\overline{\star\beta}) = \dbar\alpha\wedge\overline{\star\beta}
+ (-1)^k\dbar(\overline{\star\beta})
\]
the integral of the left hand side over all of $X$ is $0$ as a consequence of Stokes'
theorem, which gives us
\[
\int_X \dbar\alpha\wedge\overline{\star\beta} =
\int_X(-1)^{k+1}\alpha\wedge\dbar(\overline{\star\beta}) =
\int_X(-1)^{k+1}\alpha\wedge\overline{\partial\star\beta}
\]
The left hand side is $(\dbar\alpha,\beta)_{L^2}$. We claim (as was the case with
$d^*$), that the right hand side is equal to $(\alpha,\dbar^*\beta)$. We compute
\begin{align*}
(\alpha,\dbar^*\beta)_{L^2} &= \int_X \alpha \wedge \overline{\star\partial^*\beta} \\
&= \int_X\alpha \wedge \overline{\star(-\star\partial\star\beta)} \\
&= -\int_X\alpha\wedge\overline{\star^2\partial\star\beta} \\
&= (-1)^{k(n-k)+1}\int_X\alpha\wedge\overline{\partial\star\beta}
\end{align*}
We note that since $X$ is a complex manifold, $n$ is even, so this is equal to
\[
(-1)^{k^2+1}\int_X\alpha\wedge\overline{\partial\star\beta}
= (-1)^{k+1}\int_X\alpha\wedge\overline{\partial\star\beta} = (\dbar\alpha,\beta)_{L^2}
\]
where we use the fact that $k$ and $k^2$ have the same parity.
\end{proof}
%
A similar story holds for the $\dbar$ operator on a holomorphic vector bundle
$E \to X$. Suppose $\dim_\C X = n$, so $\dim X = 2n$, and let $E \to X$ be a
holomorphic vector bundle equipped with a Hermitian metric. Let $\omega$ denote
the K\"ahler form of $X$. Then $\omega^n \in \Omega^{n,n}_X$ determines a trivialization
$\Lambda^{n,n}T^*X \to X \times\C$, which introduces a pairing
\begin{align*}
\Lambda^{0,q}T^*X \otimes \Lambda^{n,n-q}T^*X &\to \C \\
\alpha\otimes\beta &\mapsto \lambda
\end{align*}
where $\lambda \in \C$ is the unique number where $\alpha\wedge\beta = \lambda\omega^n$.
This pairing is nondegenerate, which establishes the duality
\[
\Lambda^{0,q}T^*X \cong (\Lambda^{n,n-q}T^*X)^*
\]
tensoring with the holomorphic vector bundle $E$, we get the duality
\[
\Lambda^{0,q}T^*X \otimes E \cong \Lambda^{n,n-q}T^*X \otimes E^*
\]
Furthermore, the Hermitian metrics on both $E$ and $X$ gives an antilinear isomorphism
\[
\Lambda^{0,q}T^*X \otimes E \to (\Lambda^{0,q}T^*X \otimes E)^*
\]
putting these together, we get an antilinear isomorphism
\[
\Lambda^{0,q}T^*X \otimes E \to (\Lambda^{0,q}T^*X \otimes E)^* \to \Lambda^{n,n-q}T^*X
\]
which we denote $\star_E$. As the notation suggestions, $\star_E$ is the analogue of
the Hodge star operator. Let $\langle\cdot,\cdot\rangle$ denote the Hermitian metric
on $E$. Then given $E$-valued forms $\alpha,\beta \in \Omega^{0,q}_X(E)$, we get
a smooth function $X \to \C$ where $x\mapsto \langle\alpha_x,\beta_x\rangle$. The
Hermitian metric on $X$ induces a Riemannian metric, which then gives a volume form
$dV_g \in \Omega^{2n}_X$. This gives an $L_2$ metric $(\cdot,\cdot)_{L^2}$ on
$\Omega^{0,q}_X(E)$ defined by
\[
(\alpha,\beta)_{L^2} = \int_X \langle\alpha,\beta\rangle~dV_g
\]
as before, this inner product is related to $\star_E$ via the identity
\[
(\alpha,\beta)_{L^2} = \int_X\alpha\wedge\star_E\beta
\]
We first clarify the notation $\alpha\wedge\star_E\beta$. Given
$\beta\in\Omega^{0,q}_X(E)$, we have that $\star_E\beta \in \Omega^{n,n-q}_X(E^*)$
Wedging with $\alpha$ gives us a form in $\Omega^{n,n}_X(E \otimes E^*)$, and
contracting $E$ with $E^*$ gives us an element of $\Omega_X^{n,n}$, which we can
integrate over $X$. \\

We then use $\star_E$ to define an adjoint to $\dbar_E$.
%
\begin{defn}
Define $\dbar_E^* : \Omega^{0,q}_X(E) \to \Omega^{0,q-1}_X(E)$ by
\[
(-1)^q\star_E\inv\dbar_{K_X\otimes E^*}\star_E
\]
\end{defn}
%
\begin{prop}
$\dbar_E^*$ is the formal adjoint of $\dbar_E$ with respect to $(\cdot,\cdot)_{L^2}$.
\end{prop}
%
The proof is very similar to the ones we performed above. \\

With these adjoint operators, we construct Laplacian operators.
%
\begin{defn}
Define the Laplacians $\Delta$, $\Delta_\partial$, $\Delta_{\dbar}$, and
$\Delta_E$ by
\begin{align*}
&\Delta = dd^* + d^*d \\
&\Delta_\partial = \partial\partial^* + \partial^*\partial \\
&\Delta_{\dbar} = \dbar\dbar^* + \dbar^*\dbar \\
&\Delta_E = \dbar_E\dbar_E^* + \dbar_E^*\dbar_E
\end{align*}
Forms that are annihilated by their respective Laplacian operator are said to be
\ib{harmonic}. The subspace of harmonic forms is denoted
\begin{enumerate}
  \item $\mathcal{H}^k(X)$ for $\Delta$.
  \item $\mathcal{H}^{q,0}(X)$ for $\Delta_\partial$.
  \item $\mathcal{H}^{0,q}(X)$ for $\Delta_{\dbar}$.
  \item $\mathcal{H}^{0,q}(X,E)$ for $\Delta_E$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{defn}
%
We first prove some helpful properties of these Laplacian operators
%
\begin{prop}
\[
(\alpha,\Delta\beta)_{L^2} = (d\alpha,d\beta)_{L^2} + (d^*\alpha,d^*\beta)_{L^2}
\]
and the analogous statement for all the other Laplacians.
\end{prop}
%
\begin{proof}
We compute
\begin{align*}
(\alpha,\Delta\beta)_{L^2} &= (\alpha, dd^*\beta + d^*d\beta)_{L^2} \\
&= (\alpha,dd^*\beta)_{L^2} + (\alpha,d^*d\beta)_{L^2} \\
&= (d^*\alpha,d^*\beta) + (d\alpha,d\beta)
\end{align*}
where the last equality comes from the fact that $d$ and $d^*$ are adjoints. The
proof is the same for all the other Laplacians.
\end{proof}
%
\begin{prop}
A $k$-form $\alpha$ is harmonic if and only if $d\alpha = d^*\alpha = 0$,
and the analogous statements for $\partial$, $\dbar$, and $\dbar_E$.
\end{prop}
%
\begin{proof}
This is an immediate corollary of the previous proposition, along with the fact that
$(\cdot,\cdot)_{L^2}$ is positive definite.
\end{proof}
%
\begin{cor}
The Laplacians are formally self-adjoint, i.e.
\[
(\Delta\alpha,\beta)_{L^2} = (\alpha,\Delta\beta)_{L^2}
\]
and a similar statement for the other Laplacians.
\end{cor}
%
We will use the following properties of the Laplacian operators, but will not
prove them.
%TODO prove Laplacians are elliptic

\section{The Hodge Decomposition}
%
The Hodge decomposition is an immediate corollary of the above proposition and the
fact that the Laplacian is self-adjoint.
%
\begin{cor}[\ib{The Hodge decomposition}]
For a compact Riemannian manifold $(X,g)$, there is an orthogonal decomposition
\[
\Omega_X^k = \mathcal{H}^k(X) \oplus \mathrm{Im}~\Delta
\]
\end{cor}
%
\begin{cor}
The canonical map $\mathcal{H}^k(X) \to H^k_{dR}(X)$ mapping a harmonic form $\alpha$
to its de Rham cohomology class is an isomorphism
\end{cor}
%
\begin{proof}
Let $\beta \in \Omega^k_X$ be a closed form. By the Hodge decomposition, we can
write
\begin{align*}
\beta &= \alpha + \Delta\eta \\
&= \alpha + dd^*\eta + d^*d\eta
\end{align*}
with $\alpha \in \mathcal{H}^k(X)$ and some $\eta \in \Omega^k_X$. Since $\alpha$ is
harmonic, we have that $d\alpha = 0$, and we also have that $ddd^*\eta = 0$ since
$d^2 = 0$, so for $\beta$ to be closed, we must have $dd^*d\eta = 0$ as well.
Therefore, $[\beta] = [\alpha]$, so the map $\alpha \mapsto [\alpha]$ is surjective.
For injectivity, let $\alpha \in \mathcal{H}^k(X)$ with $[\alpha] = 0$, i.e. $\alpha$
is exact. Since $\alpha$ is harmonic, we have that $d\alpha = d^*\alpha = 0$. Since the
kernel of $d^*$ is orthogonal to the image of $d$ (which is a general fact about
adjoint linear transformations), we conclude that $\alpha = 0$, so the map is injective,
and therefore an isomorphism.
\end{proof}
%
As expected, we have a similar situation for the $\Delta_E$-harmonic forms and
the sheaf cohomology $H^q(X,E)$ for a holomorphic vector bundle $E$, which is naturally
identified with the Dolbeault cohomology groups $H^{0,q}(X,E)$. A near identical proof
gives us that the map $\mathcal{H}^{0,q}(X,E) \to H^q(X,E)$ is an isomorphism. \\

The Hodge decomposition gives us easy proofs of various duality theorems.
%
\begin{thm}[\ib{Poincar\'e Duality}]
For a compact manifold $X$, the pairing
$H^k_{dR}(X) \otimes H^{n-k}_{dR}(X) \to \R$ defined by
\[
\langle[\alpha],[\beta]\rangle = \int_X \alpha \wedge \beta
\]
is nondegenerate, giving an isomorphism $H^k_{dR}(X) \cong (H^{n-k}_{dR}(X))^*$.
\end{thm}
%
\begin{proof}
Fix a Riemannian metric $g$ for $X$, which allows us to construct the Laplacian
$\Delta$ and the spaces $\mathcal{H}^k(X)$, which are isomorphic to the de Rham
cohomology groups $H^k_{dR}(X)$. We use a lemma, which is a result from a simple
(but somewhat tedious) computation.
\begin{lem}
The Hodge star $\star$ commutes with $\Delta$.
\end{lem}
In particular, the lemma implies that if $\alpha \neq 0$ is harmonic, then $\star\alpha$
is also a nonzero harmonic form. Therefore, it suffices to show that
$\langle[\alpha],[\star\alpha]\rangle \neq 0$ for $\alpha \neq 0$. But
\[
\langle[\alpha],[\star\alpha]\rangle = \int_X \alpha\wedge\star\alpha
= (\alpha,\alpha)_{L^2} \neq 0
\]
\end{proof}
%
A little extra work gets the holomorphic vector bundle analogue, which is
\ib{Serre duality}. Given a holomorphic vector bundle $E \to X$, there is a natural
pairing
\[
H^{q}(X,E) \otimes H^{n-q}(X,E^* \otimes K_X) \to H^q(X, K_X) \to \C
\]
where the first map contracts the $E$ and $E^*$ factors, and the second map
is given by integration over $X$. Once we make the proper identification of this
pairing with Dolbeault cohomology, we can use the same technique we used for proving
Poincar\'e duality to prove that this pairing is nondegenerate. In Dolbeault cohomology,
let $\alpha \in H^{0,q}(X,E)$ and $\beta \in H^{0,n-q}(X,E^*\otimes K_X)$. Then
we can take the exterior product
$\alpha\wedge\beta \in H^{0,n}(X,E\otimes E^*\otimes K_X)$, which is obtained by
class of the product of two representatives. Contracting the $E$ and $E^*$ factors
gives us an element of $H^{0,n}(X,K_X)$, which is canonically identified with
$H^{2n}(X,\C) = H^{n,n}(X)$. Integration then gives the pairing.
%
\begin{thm}[\ib{Serre duality}]
The pairing
\[
H^{q}(X,E) \otimes H^{n-q}(X,E^* \otimes K_X) \to \C
\]
defined above is nondegenerate.
\end{thm}
%
\begin{proof}
The proof is similar to the one of Poincar\'e duality. From the discussion above, we
prove the pairing with Dolbeault cohomology. Fix Hermitian metrics on $E$ and $X$,
giving us the operator $\Delta_E$ and the spaces $\mathcal{H}^{0,q}(X,E)$ of harmonic
forms, which are isomorphic to the cohomology groups $H^{0,q}(X,E) = H^q(X,E)$. As
before, we use (without proof) that $\star_E$ commutes with $\Delta_E$ to deduce
that for $\alpha$ harmonic, $\star_E\alpha$ is also harmonic. Therefore, it again
suffices to show that for $\alpha$ harmonic and nonzero, the pairing
$\langle [\alpha],[\star\alpha]\rangle$ is nonzero. However, the pairing is just
$(\alpha,\star\alpha)_{L^2}$, which is nonzero since $\alpha$ is.
\end{proof}
%
\section{Hodge Theory on K\"ahler Manifolds and the Leftschetz Decomposition}
%
We now restrict to the case where $X$ is a compact K\"ahler manifold.
%
\begin{defn}
Let $X$ be a compact K\"ahler manifold with K\"ahler form $\omega \in \Omega^2_X(\C)$.
Then define the \ib{Lefschetz operator} $L : \Omega^k_X(\C) \to \Omega^{k+2}_X(\C)$ by
\[
L\alpha = \omega \wedge \alpha
\]
Let $\Lambda : \Omega^k_X(\C) \to \Omega^{k-2}_X(\C)$ denote the adjoint to $L$ with
respect to the metric on each fiber, i.e. for all $x \in X$ we have that
\[
\langle L_x\alpha_x,\beta_x\rangle_x = \langle\alpha_x,\Lambda_x\beta_x\rangle_x
\]
\end{defn}
%
\begin{prop}
\[
\Lambda = \star\inv L\star = (-1)^k\star L\star
\]
\end{prop}
%
\begin{proof}
Let $dV_g$ be the volume form for the Riemannian metric induced by the Hermitian form
on $X$. Then by definition, we have that
\[
\langle L\alpha,\beta\rangle~dV_g = \langle\alpha,\Lambda\beta\rangle~dV_g
\]
Expanding this out, we get
\[
\omega\wedge\alpha\wedge\star\beta = \alpha\wedge\star\Lambda\beta
\]
Then we have that
\[
\alpha\wedge\star\star\inv L\star\beta = \alpha\wedge L\star\beta
=\alpha\wedge\omega\star\beta = \omega\wedge\alpha\wedge\star\beta
\]
where the last equality comes from the fact that $\omega$ is of even degree. Then
by uniqueness of the adjoint, we conclude that $\Lambda$ is of the desired form.
\end{proof}
%
The operator $\Lambda$ satisfies very important commutation relations with
the operators $\partial$ and $\dbar$.
%
\begin{thm}[\ib{The K\"ahler Identities}]
\[
[\Lambda,\partial] = i\dbar^* \qquad [\Lambda,\dbar] = -i\partial^*
\]
\end{thm}
%
\begin{proof}
Since the Kahler metric is constant to second order, and the operators in question only
use the metric to first order, it suffices to prove the K\"ahler identities for the
standard Hermitian metric on $\C^n$. The two equalities are equivalent by passing to
the complex conjugate, so it suffices to verify one of them, which we choose to
be $[\Lambda, \dbar] = -i\partial^*$. Since the Hodge star $\star$ and $\Lambda$ are
both $0$-th order operators, and $\partial$ and $\dbar$ are first order, the operators
$[\Lambda,\dbar]$ and $-i\partial^*$ are both first order operators. Furthermore, both
operators annihilate constant coefficient forms, so the $0^{th}$ order terms are
trivial. Therefore, it suffices to verify the first order terms (i.e. the symbols).
are the same. The symbol of $d$ is the map $\alpha \mapsto \varepsilon_\alpha$, where
$\varepsilon_\alpha: \Omega^k_X(\C) \to \Omega^k_X(\C)$ is defined by
$\varepsilon_\alpha(\beta) = \alpha\wedge\beta$. The decomposition
$d = \partial + \dbar$ then gives us the symbol of $\dbar$ is the mapping
$\alpha \mapsto \varepsilon_{\alpha^{0,1}}$, where $\alpha^{0,1}$ is the projection of
$\alpha$ onto antiholomorphic component. Therefore, we may assume that $\alpha$ is type
$(0,1)$. Then the symbol of $-i\partial^* = i\star\dbar\star$ is
$i\star\varepsilon_\alpha\star$. Since $\Lambda$ is order $0$, we are reduced
to verifying the identity
\[
[\Lambda,\varepsilon_\alpha] = i\star\varepsilon_\alpha\star
\]
by linearity, we can further assume that $\alpha$ is one of the basis elements
$d\zbar^i$ for the standard coordinates $\set{z^i}$ for $\C^n$, furthermore, we may
assume that $\alpha = d\zbar^1$. We then prove a series of lemmas.
%
\begin{lem}
We have that
\[
\star\varepsilon_{d\zbar^1}\star = 2\iota_1
\]
where $\iota_1\beta = \beta(\partial/\partial z^1)$.
\end{lem}
%
\begin{proof}
We have that $d\zbar^1 = dx^1 - idy^1$, so we compute on those components separately.
It also suffices to verify on the basis $dx^I \wedge dy^J$ for
$I = \set{i_1,\ldots, i_p}$ and $J = \set{j_1,\ldots, j_q}$ where $p+q=k$. We note that
if $1 \notin I$, then $\star(dx^I \wedge dy^J)$ will contain $dx^1$ as a factor,
so it is annihilated by $\varepsilon_{dx^1}$. Otherwise, $\star(dx^I\wedge dy^J)$ will
not contain a factor of $dx^1$, so after checking signs,
$\star\inv\varepsilon_{dx^1}(dx^I\wedge dy^J)$ will be $dx^I \wedge dy^J$ except
the factor of $dx^1$ is missing. Therefore, we have that
\begin{align*}
\star\varepsilon_{d\zbar^1}\star
&= \star(\varepsilon_{dx^1} -i\varepsilon_{dy^1})\star  \\
&= \iota_{dx^1} - i\iota_{dy^1} \\
&= 2\iota_1
\end{align*}
\end{proof}
%
\begin{lem}
\[
L\circ\iota_1 = \iota_1\circ L - \frac{i}{2}\varepsilon_{d\zbar^1}
\]
\end{lem}
%
\begin{proof}
Let $\eta \in \Omega^k_X(\C)$.Then we compute
\begin{align*}
(L\circ\iota_1)(\eta) &= (\omega\wedge\iota_1\eta) \\
&= \frac{i}{2}\sum_i dz^i\wedge d\zbar^i \wedge\iota_1\eta
\end{align*}
on the other hand, we have
\begin{align*}
(\iota_1\circ L - \frac{i}{2}\varepsilon_{d\zbar^1})(\eta)
&= \frac{i}{2}\left(\sum_i \iota_1(dz^i\wedge d\zbar^i\wedge\eta)
- d\zbar^1\wedge\eta\right) \\
&= \frac{i}{2}\left(\sum_i (\iota_1(dz^i\wedge d\zbar^i)\wedge\eta + dz^1\wedge
d\zbar^i\wedge\iota_1\eta) - d\zbar^1\wedge\eta\right)
\end{align*}
where the computation on the second line comes from the identity
\[
\iota_1(\alpha \wedge \eta) = \iota_1(\alpha)\wedge\eta
+ (-1)^{|\alpha|} \alpha\wedge\iota_1\eta
\]
with $\alpha = dz^i\wedge d\zbar^i$. We note that the only $i$ for which
 $\iota_1(dz^i\wedge d\zbar^i) \neq 0$ is when $i=1$,
in which case
\[
\iota_1(dz^1\wedge d\zbar^1) = \frac{1}{2} d\zbar^1
\]
the equality then immediately follows.
\end{proof}
%
\begin{lem}
\[
\star L\star\inv = \star\inv L\star
\]
\end{lem}
%
\begin{proof}
Since the dimension of $X$ is even dimensional, we have that
$\star\inv\beta = (-1)^{|\beta|}\star\beta$. Since $\omega$ is a two form, wedging
with $\omega$ preserves the parity of the degree. The lemma immediately follows.
\end{proof}
%
We then compute $[\Lambda,\varepsilon_{d\zbar^1}]$ to be
\begin{align*}
[\Lambda,\varepsilon_{d\zbar^1}]
&= \Lambda\varepsilon_{d\zbar^1} - \varepsilon_{d\zbar^1}\Lambda \\
&= \star\inv L\star\varepsilon_{d\zbar^1} - \varepsilon_{d\zbar^1}\star\inv L\star \\
&= 2\star\inv L\circ\iota_1\star\inv - \varepsilon_{d\zbar^1}\star L\star\inv
\end{align*}
where the last equality uses the fact that
$\star\varepsilon_{d\zbar^1} = 2\iota_1\star\inv$ (an immediate consequence of Lemma
7.4), and lemma 7.6. We then apply Lemma 7.5 to obtain
\begin{align*}
2\star\inv L\circ\iota_1\star\inv - \varepsilon_{d\zbar^1}\star L\star\inv
&= 2\star\inv\left(\iota_1\circ L - \frac{i}{2}\varepsilon_{d\zbar^1}\right)\star\inv
- 2\star\inv\iota_1\circ L\star\inv \\
&= 2\star\inv\iota_1\circ L\star\inv - i\star\inv\varepsilon_{d\zbar^1}\star\inv
- 2\star\inv\iota_1\circ L\star\inv \\
&= -i\star\inv\varepsilon_{d\zbar^1}\star\inv
\end{align*}
a quick verification with signs shows that this is equal to
$i\star\varepsilon_{d\zbar^1}\star$, which is what we wanted to show.
\end{proof}
%
The K\"ahler identities establish an important relationship between the Laplacians
$\Delta$, $\Delta_\partial$, and $\Delta_{\dbar}$.
%
\begin{thm}
Let $X$ be a K\"ahler manifold. Then the Laplacians satisfy
\[
\Delta_\partial = \Delta_{\dbar} = \frac{1}{2}\Delta
\]
\end{thm}
%
\begin{proof}
We first prove a short lemma.
\begin{lem}
\[
\partial^*\dbar = -\dbar\partial^*
\]
\end{lem}
%
\begin{proof}
We compute
\begin{align*}
\partial^*\dbar &= -i[\Lambda,\dbar]\dbar \\
&= (-i\Lambda\dbar + i\dbar\Lambda)\dbar \\
&= -i\Lambda\dbar\dbar + i\dbar\Lambda\dbar \\
&= i\dbar\Lambda\dbar
\end{align*}
On the other hand, we compute
\begin{align*}
-\dbar\partial^* &= -i\dbar[\Lambda,\dbar] \\
&= -i\dbar\Lambda\dbar + i\dbar\dbar\Lambda \\
&= -i\dbar\Lambda\dbar
\end{align*}
\end{proof}
Using the decomposition $d = \partial + \dbar$ and the definition $\Delta = dd^* +d^*d$,
we compute
\begin{align*}
\Delta &= (\partial + \dbar)(\partial^* + \dbar^*)
+ (\partial^* + \dbar^*)(\partial + \dbar) \\
&= (\partial + \dbar)(\partial^* - i[\Lambda,\partial])
+ (\partial^* -i[\Lambda,\partial])(\partial + \dbar) \\
&= (\partial + \dbar)(\partial^* - i\Lambda\partial +i\partial\Lambda)
+ (\partial^* - i\Lambda\partial +i\partial\Lambda)(\partial + \dbar) \\
&= \partial\partial^* + \dbar\partial^* -i\partial\Lambda\partial -i\dbar\Lambda\partial
+i\dbar\partial\Lambda + \partial^*\partial + \partial^*\dbar -i\Lambda\partial\dbar
+i\partial\Lambda\partial +i\partial\Lambda\dbar \\
&= \partial\partial^* + \dbar\partial^* -i\dbar\Lambda\partial + i\dbar\partial\Lambda
+\partial^*\partial + \partial^*\dbar -i\Lambda\partial\dbar + i\partial\Lambda\dbar \\
&= \partial\partial^* +\partial^*\partial -i\dbar\Lambda\partial
+ i\dbar\partial\Lambda -i\Lambda\partial\dbar + i\partial\Lambda\dbar \\
&= \Delta_\partial + i\partial[\Lambda,\dbar] + i[\Lambda,\dbar]\partial \\
&= \Delta_{\partial} + \partial\partial^* + \partial^*\partial \\
&= 2\Delta_{\partial}
\end{align*}
the proof for $\Delta_{\dbar}$ is near identical.
\end{proof}
%
\begin{cor}
The Laplacian $\Delta$ preserves the bigrading on $\Omega_X^{\bullet,\bullet}$,
i.e. for a $(p,q)$ form $\alpha$, the form $\Delta\alpha \in \Omega_X^{p,q}$.
\end{cor}
%
\begin{cor}
A complex $k$-form $\alpha \in \Omega^k_X(\C)$ is $\Delta$-harmonic if and only if
its components $\alpha^{p,q} \in \Omega^{p,q}_X$ are all $\Delta$-harmonic.
\end{cor}
%
\begin{cor}[\ib{Hodge decomposition for K\"ahler manifolds}]
\[
\mathcal{H}^k(X) = \bigoplus_{p+q=k}\mathcal{H}^{p,q}(X)
\]
\end{cor}
%
We also get a decomposition of the cohomology $H^k(X,\C)$, but this isn't as immediate
as one would think. The na\"ive idea is to use the isomorphism
$\mathcal{H}^K(X) \to H^k(X,\C)$, and then obtain the decomposition
\[
H^k(X,\C) = \bigoplus_{p+q=k}H^{p,q}(X,\C)
\]
where $H^{p,q}(X,\C)$ is defined to be the image of $\mathcal{H}^{p,q}(X)$ under
the natural map. However, the space of harmonic forms depends on the choice of Hermitian
metric, so a priori there could be different decompositions depending on the metric.
However, this is not the case.
%
\begin{thm}
The decomposition
\[
H^k(X,\C) = \bigoplus_{p+q=k}H^{p,q}(X,\C)
\]
induced by the Hodge decomposition does not depend on the choice of metric.
\end{thm}
%
\begin{proof}
We let $K^{p,q} \subset H^k(X,\C)$ denote the space of cohomology classes that admit a
representative of type $(p,q)$. Clearly, $K^{p,q}$ does not use the metric, so it
we prove the inclusion $K^{p,q} \subset H^{p,q}(X,\C)$, we are done. Given a class
$[\eta] \in K^{p,q}$, by the definition of $K^{p,q}$, we may assume $\eta$ is a
closed form of type $(p,q)$. By the Hodge decomposition, we write
$\eta = \alpha + \Delta\beta$, with $\alpha$ a harmonic form. By projecting onto
$\Omega^{p,q}_X$, we have that $\eta = \alpha^{p,q} + \Delta\beta^{p,q}$, and
$\alpha^{p,q}$ is still harmonic by Corollary 7.11. Expanding this out, we have
$\eta = \alpha^{p,q} + dd^*\beta^{p,q} + d^*d\beta^{p,q}$. Then since $\eta$ is closed,
we have that $d\eta = 0$. Since $d\alpha^{p,q} = 0$ and $ddd^*\beta^{p,q} = 0$, we
must have that $dd^8d\beta^{p,q} = 0$, and by orthogonality of $\ker d$ with
$\mathrm{Im}~d^*$, we have that $d^*d\beta^{p,q} = 0$. Therefore,
$\eta = \alpha^{p,q} + dd^*\beta^{p,q}$, where $\alpha^{p,q}$ is a harmonic $(p,q)$
form, which is in $H^{p,q}(X,\C)$ by definition. Therefore, $[\eta] = [\alpha^{p,q}]$,
proving the inclusion.
\end{proof}
%
Since $H^{p,q}(X,\C) = K^{p,q}$, we note that this implies
$H^{p,q}(X,\C) = \overline{H^{q,p}(X,\C)}$, since we clearly
have that $K^{p,q} = \overline{K^{q,p}}$.
%
\begin{thm}
Let $X$ be a K\"ahler manifold. Then the odd dimensional cohomology groups
$H^{2k+1}(X,\C)$ are even dimensional
\end{thm}
%
\begin{proof}
By the Hodge decomposition, we have
\[
H^{2k+1} = \bigoplus_{p+q=2k+1}H^{p,q}(X,\C)
= \bigoplus_{i=0}^{2k+1}H^{i, 2k+1-i}(X,\C)
= \bigoplus_{i=0}^kH^{i,2k+1-i} \oplus \overline{H^{i,2k+1-i}}
\]
and $\dim V = \dim\overline{V}$, this implies that $H^k(X,\C)$ is even dimensional.
\end{proof}
%
We now prove an extremely useful result.
%
\begin{thm}[\ib{The $\partial\dbar$ lemma}]
Let $X$ be a K\"ahler manifold, and $\eta$ a complex $k$-form that is $\partial$
and $\dbar$-closed. Then if $\eta$ is $d$, $\partial$, or $\dbar$-exact, there exists
a form $\xi$ such that $\eta = \partial\dbar\xi$.
\end{thm}
%
\begin{proof}
The proof for all three cases is much the same, so we do just the one where
$\eta = \dbar\alpha$ is $\dbar$-exact. By the Hodge decomposition, we write
$\alpha = \beta + \Delta\gamma$, with $\beta$ harmonic. Since
$\Delta = 2\Delta_{\dbar}$, and $\beta$ is $\Delta_{\dbar}$-harmonic if and only
if $\dbar\beta = \dbar^*\beta = 0$, we have that $\dbar\beta = 0$. Then
using Lemma 7.8, we compute
\begin{align*}
\eta &= \dbar\alpha \\
&= \dbar(\beta + \Delta\gamma) \\
&= \dbar\beta + 2\dbar(\Delta_\partial\gamma) \\
&= 0 + 2\dbar(\partial\partial^*\gamma + \partial^*\partial\gamma) \\
&= 2\dbar\partial\partial^*\gamma - 2\partial^*\dbar\partial\gamma \\
&= -2\partial\dbar\partial^*\gamma - 2\partial^*\dbar\partial\gamma
\end{align*}
Then since $\eta$ is $\partial$-closed, we have that $\partial^*\dbar\partial\gamma$
must also be $\partial$-closed. By orthogonality of the image of $\partial^*$ with
the kernel of $\partial$, we have that $\partial^*\dbar\partial\gamma = 0$,
so $\eta = -2\partial\dbar\partial^*\gamma = 2\dbar\partial\partial^*\gamma$,
so letting $\xi = \partial^*\gamma$, we are done.
\end{proof}
%
